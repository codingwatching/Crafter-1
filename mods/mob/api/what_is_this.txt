Elements of this api were getting so complicated I was basically searching through the entire file for individual functions 98% of the time.

So I've decided to do a builder pattern for mobs. Each of these files contains a function specific to streaming the required data & methods of that mob into it.

These classifications so far are broken down as such:

required ->
-- requred #All mobs utilize some instance of these methods, hence the name

attack ->
-- none
-- punch
-- jump
-- explode
-- projectile

locomotion ->
-- walk
-- jump
-- swim
-- fly

You can probably see this looks like a java project. Oops.
